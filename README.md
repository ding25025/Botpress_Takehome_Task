# Botepress Takehome Task

<!-- Write a function that takes English text as an input and returns an improved version of that text. You can determine any improvement criteria yourself. It can be completely subjective. You can also use whatever tools or libraries you want.

Poor examples:
All single “c”s become “k”s, regardless of pronunciation. (too simple)
Replace the entire grammar system with Spanish grammar. (too complex)

Good examples: 
replace all “z”s in words like comprize with “s”s
replace all “c”s with “k”s and “s” depending on the location
replace all “bb” in words like "bobby" with “b”

You must use an analytics platform to demonstrate your chosen improvement. By the end of this task, you should run a script on a corpus of English text (anything here works https://www.gutenberg.org/). Your goal will be to demonstrate your improvement quantitatively by running this script on your chosen corpus, and to illustrate your chosen improvement on this corpus.

You can use the Mixpanel SDK in any language, or a free tracking solution of your choice.

Mixpanel is a tool to track analytics events and display them in charts.  -->
